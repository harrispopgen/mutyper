    abstract = "{Great ape clades exhibit variation in the relative mutation rates of different three-base-pair genomic motifs, with closely related species having more similar mutation spectra than distantly related species. This pattern cannot be explained by classical demographic or selective forces, but imply that DNA replication fidelity has been perturbed in different ways on each branch of the great ape phylogeny. Here, we use whole-genome variation from 88 great apes to investigate whether these species’ mutation spectra are broadly differentiated across the entire genome, or whether mutation spectrum differences are driven by DNA compartments that have particular functional features or chromatin states. We perform principal component analysis (PCA) and mutational signature deconvolution on mutation spectra ascertained from compartments defined by features including replication timing and ancient repeat content, finding evidence for consistent species-specific mutational signatures that do not depend on which functional compartments the spectra are ascertained from. At the same time, we find that many compartments have their own characteristic mutational signatures that appear stable across the great ape phylogeny. For example, in a mutation spectrum PCA compartmentalized by replication timing, the second principal component explaining 21.2\\% of variation separates all species’ late-replicating regions from their early-replicating regions. Our results suggest that great ape mutation spectrum evolution is not driven by epigenetic changes that modify mutation rates in specific genomic regions, but instead by trans-acting mutational modifiers that affect mutagenesis across the whole genome fairly uniformly.}",

	abstract = {Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within segmental duplications (SDs) have not been systematically assessed because of the difficulty in mapping short-read sequence data to virtually identical repetitive sequences. Using 102 phased human haplotypes, we constructed 1:1 unambiguous alignments spanning high-identity SDs and compared the pattern of SNVs between unique and SD regions. We find that human SNVs are elevated 60\% in SDs compared to unique regions. We estimate that at least 23\% of this increase is due to interlocus gene conversion (IGC) with \&gt;7 Mbp of SD sequence converted on average per human haplotype. We develop a genome-wide map of IGC donors and acceptors, including 498 acceptor and 454 donor hotspots affecting the exons of ~800 protein-coding genes. The latter includes 171 genes that have {\textquotedblleft}relocated{\textquotedblright} on average 1.61 Mbp in a subset of human haplotypes. Using a coalescent framework, we show that SD regions are evolutionarily older when compared to unique sequences with most of this signal originating from putative IGC loci. SNVs within SDs, however, also exhibit a distinct mutational spectrum where there is a 27.1\% increase in transversions that convert cytosine to guanine or the reverse across all triplet contexts. In addition, we observe a 7.6\% reduction in the frequency of CpG associated mutations when compared to unique DNA. We hypothesize that these distinct mutational properties help to maintain an overall higher GC content of SD DNA when compared to unique DNA, and we show that these GC-favoring mutational events are likely driven by GC-biased conversion between paralogous sequences.Competing Interest StatementE.E.E. is a scientific advisory board (SAB) member of Variant Bio, Inc.},
